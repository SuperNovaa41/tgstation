  - rscadd: "Mechs now have a weapons safety, which can be toggled with the Middle Mouse button. Don't worry, it defaults to off.
expansion: All mechs now use the mouse reticle, and the reticle is disabled when weapons safety is turned on."
  - bugfix: "AIs can use mech equipment again. With weapons safety off, equipment is used. With weapons safety on, AI clicks are used."
